# Optimization

##  Memory Management Optimizations:

### Smart Pointer Usage:

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<client> wsClient = std::make_unique<client>();
std::unique_ptr<std::thread> wsThread = std::make_unique<std::thread>();
```

*   Smart pointers ensure automatic memory cleanup and prevent memory leaks
*   RAII principle is followed for resource management
*   Eliminates need for manual deletion in destructor

### Static Thread-Local Storage:

```cpp
static thread_local json parser;
static thread_local std::string buffer;
```

*   Thread-local storage prevents memory contention
*   Each thread gets its own parser instance
*   Reduces memory allocation/deallocation overhead

### Connection Pool Implementation:

```cpp
class ConnectionPool {
private:
    std::vector<CURL*> connections;
    std::mutex pool_mutex;
    size_t max_connections;
    //...
}
```

*   Reuses CURL connections instead of creating new ones
*   Prevents memory fragmentation
*   Reduces allocation/deallocation overhead

## Network Communication Optimizations:

### Connection Pooling:

*   Maintains a pool of pre-initialized CURL connections
*   Reduces connection establishment overhead
*   Implements connection reuse strategy

### Rate Limiting:

```cpp
class RateLimiter {
    std::deque<std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point> request_times;
    const size_t max_requests;
    const std::chrono::seconds window;
    //...
}
```

*   Prevents server overload
*   Implements sliding window rate limiting
*   Ensures optimal API usage

### Circuit Breaker Pattern:

```cpp
class CircuitBreaker {
    std::atomic<int> failure_count{0};
    std::atomic<bool> is_open{false};
    //...
}
```

*   Prevents cascade failures
*   Implements automatic service recovery
*   Reduces network load during failures

##  Data Structure Selection:

### Order Book Implementation:

```cpp
class OrderBook {
    std::map<double, double> bids;  // price -> volume
    std::map<double, double> asks;  // price -> volume
    //...
}
```

*   Uses ordered maps for efficient price-level management
*   Automatic sorting of price levels
*   O(log n) complexity for updates and queries

### Subscription Management:

```cpp
std::unordered_set<std::string> subscribed_instruments;
```

*   O(1) lookup time for subscriptions
*   Memory efficient for string storage
*   Fast insertion and deletion

### Request Queue Management:

```cpp
std::queue<std::function<void()>> tasks;
```

*   FIFO processing of tasks
*   Efficient memory usage for task storage
*   Thread-safe implementation

## Thread Management Optimizations:

### Thread Pool Implementation:

```cpp
class ThreadPool {
    std::vector<std::thread> workers;
    std::queue<std::function<void()>> tasks;
    std::condition_variable condition;
    //...
}
```

*   Dynamic task distribution across worker threads
*   Prevents thread creation/destruction overhead
*   Uses hardware concurrency for optimal thread count

```cpp
ThreadPool(size_t threads) : stop(false) {
    for(size_t i = 0; i < threads; ++i) {
        workers.emplace_back([this] { /* worker function */ });
    }
}
```

### Thread Synchronization:

```cpp
std::mutex pool_mutex;
std::condition_variable condition;
std::atomic<bool> isConnected{false};
std::atomic<bool> shouldStop{false};
```

*   Uses atomic variables for flag management
*   Condition variables for thread coordination
*   Fine-grained mutex locking

### WebSocket Thread Management:

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<std::thread> wsThread = std::make_unique<std::thread>();
```

*   Dedicated thread for WebSocket operations
*   Clean thread lifecycle management
*   Proper shutdown handling

##  CPU Optimization:

### SIMD Support:

```cpp
#include <immintrin.h>
// Vector getters for SIMD processing
std::vector<double> getBidPrices() const;
std::vector<double> getBidVolumes() const;
```

*   Prepared for SIMD operations on price/volume data
*   Vectorized data structure access
*   Potential for parallel processing

### Lock-Free Operations:

```cpp
static std::atomic<int> update_counter;
std::atomic<bool> isConnected{false};
```

*   Minimizes thread contention
*   Reduces CPU cache invalidation
*   Improves parallel performance

### Memory Layout Optimization:

```cpp
class OrderBook {
    std::map<double, double> bids;
    std::map<double, double> asks;
}
```

*   Cache-friendly data structures
*   Contiguous memory allocation where possible
*   Efficient data access patterns

## Bottlenecks Identified:

###  Memory-Related:

*   Potential memory fragmentation in connection pool
*   Possible excessive copying in WebSocket message handling
*   Large order book data structure memory footprint

### Network-Related:

*   Synchronous network operations in some parts
*   Fixed connection pool size might be suboptimal
*   WebSocket reconnection handling could be improved

###  Processing-Related:

*   Limited use of SIMD capabilities
*   Potential lock contention in thread pool
*   JSON parsing overhead in message handling

###  Threading-Related:

*   Fixed thread pool size might not be optimal
*   Possible thread starvation under high load
*   Lock contention in connection pool

## Potential Improvements:

###  Memory Optimizations:

*   Implement memory pooling for frequently allocated objects
*   Use stack-based allocation for small objects
*   Add custom allocators for containers

```cpp
template<typename T>
using PoolAllocator = /* custom allocator implementation */;
std::vector<double, PoolAllocator<double>> prices;
```

###  Network Improvements:

*   Implement connection pooling with dynamic sizing
*   Add connection keep-alive management
*   Implement request batching

```cpp
class DynamicConnectionPool {
    std::vector<CURL*> connections;
    size_t min_connections;
    size_t max_connections;
    // Dynamic scaling logic
};
```

###  Threading Enhancements:

*   Implement work-stealing thread pool
*   Add priority queue for tasks
*   Improve thread affinity management

```cpp
class WorkStealingThreadPool {
    struct Worker {
        std::deque<Task> local_queue;
        std::mutex queue_mutex;
    };
    std::vector<Worker> workers;
};
```

###  Performance Monitoring:

*   Add performance metrics collection
*   Implement adaptive thread scaling
*   Add latency monitoring

```cpp
class PerformanceMonitor {
    std::atomic<uint64_t> message_count{0};
    std::atomic<uint64_t> total_latency{0};
    std::atomic<uint64_t> max_latency{0};
};
```

###  CPU Optimization:

*   Implement full SIMD processing for order book updates
*   Add vectorized price level matching
*   Optimize memory alignment for SIMD operations

```cpp
alignas(32) struct PriceLevelSIMD {
    __m256d prices;
    __m256d volumes;
};
```

These improvements would significantly enhance the performance and reliability of the trading system while maintaining its current functionality.
